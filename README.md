Development Process:

1. [30 minutes] Maximize the AI helper. I spent some time to think about what the app should look like and drafted a prompt to give details as much as possible and used GPT to generate the starter code. See link: https://chatgpt.com/c/685b9447-52a8-800c-a706-0b31e53a5fca

2. [1 hr] Restructure the code to make it cleaner and modular. Fixed the bug where the newly created task does not update the tag.
